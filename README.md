10. **Step 10: Using JOIN**
    - Description: This step demonstrates performing joins between 'employees' and 'products' tables based on the 'department' column.

11. **Step 11: Using Subqueries**
    - Description: This step demonstrates the use of subqueries.

12. **Step 12: Using LIKE and Wildcards**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using LIKE with wildcard characters.

13. **Step 13: Using CASE statement**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using the CASE statement to create conditional expressions.

14. **Step 14: Using DELETE, UPDATE, and TRUNCATE**
    - Description: This step demonstrates data deletion and updating.

15. **Step 15: Using ORDER BY and GROUP BY**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using ORDER BY and GROUP BY together.

16. **Step 16: Using GROUP BY and HAVING with Aggregates**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using GROUP BY and HAVING with aggregate functions.

17. **Step 17: Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
    - Description: This step demonstrates the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

18. **Step 18: Additional Aggregating Examples**
    - Description: This step demonstrates additional examples of using aggregate functions.

19. **Step 19: Using DISTINCT with Aggregate Functions**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using DISTINCT with aggregate functions.

20. **Step 20: Using CONCAT to combine first_name and last_name into a full_name column**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using CONCAT to combine two columns into a new column.

21. **Step 21: Using LENGTH to calculate the length of product_name for all products**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using LENGTH to calculate the length of strings.

22. **Step 22: Using UPPER and LOWER to convert product_name to uppercase and lowercase, respectively**
    - Description: This step demonstrates converting strings to uppercase and lowercase.

23. **Step 23: Using LEFT and RIGHT to retrieve the first three characters and last two characters of product_name**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using LEFT and RIGHT to extract substrings.

24. **Step 24: Using SUBSTRING to get a substring from product_name starting at position 8 and taking 5 characters**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using SUBSTRING to extract substrings.

25. **Step 25: Using REPLACE to replace 'Widget' with 'Gadget' in product_name**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using REPLACE to replace text in a string.

26. **Step 26: Using TRIM to remove leading and trailing spaces from email addresses**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using TRIM to remove spaces from strings.

27. **Step 27: Using POSITION to find the position of '@' in email addresses**
    - Description: This step demonstrates using POSITION to find the position of a character in a string.
